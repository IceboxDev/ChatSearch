description: Keep git commit messages short — no long docs or bullet lists

# Commit messages

- **One short line** (or one line + optional single short line). No paragraphs, no bullet lists, no "docs" in the message.
- Good: `Add two-step RAG query expansion and compact sources UI`
- Bad: Multi-line messages with bullets, implementation details, or changelog-style lists.
